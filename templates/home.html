I am determined to find the easiest way for you to reach your goals and then some.  I always
supplement, at no extra cost, going over past work or study guides before
meeting with you to make the most out of every session.  Most physics and math
courses still teach the same way as they did in the 1960s, but I apply recent research
in Physics Education.  If relevant, emphasis will be given to computational tools
and programming.
